About the script

Texty is a text editor. When run it can create and save a text file on the command line. It does two things in one. It prompts user for file name and content and create both. It saves you from the trouble of having to open your text editor before creating a file. With texty you can create your text file on the command line.

Challanges

1. User cannot create new lines by themselves. You need to allow the text to wrap by itself.
2. This is because when the enter key is pressed it terminates the script and immediately creates and saves content.
3. To be more efficient, the script needs to be able to create a new line when the enter button is pressed.
4. And maybe perhaps terminate when the enter button is pressed twice or thrice as the case may be.
